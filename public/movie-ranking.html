        <hr/>
        <h3>Interstellar</h3>
            <p>One of Christopher Nolan's finest works. It was one of a kind</p>
        <h3>The notebook</h3>
            <p>The only romance movie I've actually watched and enjoyed well.</p>
        <h3>Requiem for a dream</h3>
            <p>A bit rough around the edges I would say but It had wonderful storytelling</p>
